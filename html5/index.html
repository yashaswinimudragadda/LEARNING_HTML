            <p>A computer is an electronic device that was discovered by Charles
                 Babbage. He is known as the father of computers. There are various
                  parts to a computer. The four major parts of a computer are the mouse, 
                  keyboard, monitor and CPU. With computers, we can send and receive messages 
                  through emails and save important information. It helps to store and modify 
                  data. Nowadays, computers are used in schools, banks, offices, etc., and it is now impossible 
                  to survive without computers. In order to run any organisation, institution, or any other office, 
                  a computer is a must. Computers have made life easier for people of different age groups.
